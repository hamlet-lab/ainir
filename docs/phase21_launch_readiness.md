# Pre-v1 Phase 21 - Launch Readiness with TrustReceipt Replay

Phase 21 does not add a new integration or downstream consumer. It turns the
TrustReceipt replay checks from Phase 19/20 into a release-readiness gate.

A public launch candidate now has to show that:

1. the Trust Gate passes the safe public fixture,
2. blocked fixtures cannot be lowered,
3. TrustReceipt issue/replay works,
4. conformance golden traces include TrustReceipt replay,
5. negative conformance fixtures still refuse non-conformant drafts,
6. documentation still states that this is pre-v1 and not production runtime,
7. public/private boundary checks pass.

The resulting decision is intentionally conservative:

```text
private_github_trial_ready: true | false
public_release_ready: false
production_runtime_ready: false
v1_final_ready: false
```

A passed Phase 21 check means the public candidate can be uploaded to a private
GitHub repository for README/CI/visibility inspection. It does not mean AiNIR is
v1.0 final.

Run:

```bash
python -m ainir phase21-launch-readiness-eval --out-dir /tmp/ainir_phase21_launch_readiness
```
