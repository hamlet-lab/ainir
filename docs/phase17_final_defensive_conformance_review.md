# Pre-v1 Phase 17 - Final Defensive Conformance Review and Launch Readiness Decision

Phase 17 is a review phase, not a new feature phase.

It checks whether the pre-v1 public demo is ready for a **private GitHub trial** before public release. It does not claim v1.0 final status, production-runtime readiness, or independent human external review.

## Review scope

The Phase 17 review checks:

1. release-candidate review runner;
2. public pre-launch check;
3. exact capability and operation/effect contract regression cases;
4. financial-effect, secret, PII, and transaction-bound negative conformance cases;
5. TypeScript skeleton emission and strict compilation when `tsc` is available;
6. documentation claim scope.

## Decision language

Possible decisions:

- `public_launch_candidate_ready_for_private_github_trial`
- `hold_public_launch`

The first decision means the repository may be uploaded to a private GitHub repository for UI/README/CI review. It does **not** mean public release is final.

## Command

```bash
python scripts/run_phase17_final_review.py --out-dir /tmp/ainir_phase17_review
```

## Boundaries

This repository remains:

```text
status: pre-v1 architecture hardening
production_runtime_ready: false
v1_final_ready: false
human_external_evaluator_status: pending
```
